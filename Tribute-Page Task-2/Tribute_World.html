    <h2>2011 ICC World Cup</h2>
    <p class="para">Arguably one of the finest ODI batsmen of all-time, and certainly the greatest of his generation,
        Virat Kohli has
        played two senior World Cups after leading the junior team to the title in 2008. In 2011, on his World Cup
        debut, Kohli played second fiddle to Virender Sehwag on his way to a fluent hundred against Bangladesh. After a
        great innings to start with, Kohli had a quiet World Cup before scoring an important 35 in the final to rescue
        the chase with Gambhir and lay the foundation for a second World Cup triumph.
